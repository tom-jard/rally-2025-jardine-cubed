## üìã Challenge Prompt

> **Making Life Skills Stick**
> 
> Essential life skills like financial literacy remain alarmingly low. The 2025 TIAA Institute‚ÄìGFLEC Index found that U.S. adults answer only 49% of financial literacy questions correctly, with Gen Z averaging just 38%. FINRA's 2025 survey showed more Americans are spending more than they earn and fewer are paying credit cards in full, pointing to growing financial fragility.
> 
> The issue isn't access to information, it's engagement. Traditional financial education feels abstract and unrelatable. Students and young adults often lack opportunities to practice skills like budgeting, investing, or debt management in safe, engaging environments. Globally, OECD's PISA assessments reveal wide disparities in financial literacy, underscoring how systemic the problem is.
> 
> Gamification offers a path forward. Duolingo turned language learning into an addictive habit for millions. Studies show that game mechanics including progression, rewards, social play all significantly improve motivation and retention. Yet most areas beyond language remain untouched. Imagine if saving money or managing credit felt as engaging as leveling up in a game.
> 
> This is a massive whitespace. Startups that make essential skills feel fun, social, and sticky can create products that help people succeed in life while also winning in the marketplace.
> 
> **How might AI and game mechanics make essential skills like money, health, or career fun to learn, practice, and master?**
