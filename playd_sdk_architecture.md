# Play'd SDK: Developer Integration Architecture

## Overview
The Play'd SDK enables game developers to integrate positive microtransactions where players earn in-game currency through real-world achievements (fitness, learning, financial goals) instead of traditional IAP spending.

## SDK Integration (3 Lines of Code)

### Basic Implementation
```javascript
// 1. Initialize SDK with game API key
PlaydSDK.initialize("your_game_api_key");

// 2. Request rewards when player needs currency/items
PlaydSDK.requestReward(amount, currency_type, callback);

// 3. Handle automatic rewards from real-world actions
PlaydSDK.onRewardEarned((reward) => {
    game.addCurrency(reward.amount, reward.type);
});
```

### Advanced Configuration
```javascript
PlaydSDK.configure({
    apiKey: "your_game_api_key",
    gameId: "your_game_id",
    currencyMapping: {
        coins: 1,        // 1 Play'd Coin = 1 Game Coin
        gems: 0.1,       // 10 Play'd Coins = 1 Gem
        energy: 5        // 1 Play'd Coin = 5 Energy
    },
    rewardCategories: ["fitness", "learning", "financial"],
    debugMode: false
});
```

## Revenue Share Model

### Economics Breakdown
- **User Action**: Completes workout + budgeting lesson = 100 Play'd Coins
- **Conversion Value**: 100 Play'd Coins = $5 of in-game currency
- **Developer Revenue**: $3.50 (70% share)
- **Play'd Revenue**: $1.50 (30% platform fee)
- **User Benefit**: $5 value earned through positive life actions

### Revenue Tiers
| Monthly Volume | Developer Share | Play'd Platform Fee |
|---|---|---|
| $0 - $1,000 | 70% | 30% |
| $1,001 - $10,000 | 75% | 25% |
| $10,001+ | 80% | 20% |

## Target Developer Segments

### 1. Indie/Mid-Tier Games (Primary)
- **Pain Point**: Need differentiation from major publishers
- **Opportunity**: New revenue stream beyond traditional IAP
- **Value Prop**: "First game to reward healthy living"
- **Examples**: Puzzle games, strategy games, simulation games

### 2. New/Upcoming Games (Early Adopters)
- **Pain Point**: Breaking through in saturated market
- **Opportunity**: Launch with unique positive monetization
- **Value Prop**: Built-in marketing angle and user acquisition
- **Examples**: Indie developers, startup game studios

### 3. Educational/Health Games (Perfect Alignment)
- **Pain Point**: Monetization challenges in purpose-driven games
- **Opportunity**: Natural fit with mission and user goals
- **Value Prop**: Align monetization with positive outcomes
- **Examples**: Fitness apps with gamification, learning platforms

## SDK Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Authentication & Security
```javascript
class PlaydAuth {
    initialize(apiKey, gameId)
    validateUser(userId)
    secureTransaction(amount, type)
    preventFraud(userPattern)
}
```

#### 2. Reward Management
```javascript
class PlaydRewards {
    requestReward(amount, currencyType, callback)
    onRewardEarned(callback)
    validateReward(rewardData)
    convertCurrency(playdCoins, gameCurrency)
}
```

#### 3. Analytics & Insights
```javascript
class PlaydAnalytics {
    trackRewardEvent(eventType, amount)
    getUserEngagement(userId)
    getRevenueMetrics(timeframe)
    exportData(format)
}
```

#### 4. Partner Integration
```javascript
class PlaydPartners {
    connectFitnessApp(provider)
    connectLearningPlatform(provider)
    connectFinancialService(provider)
    validatePartnerAction(actionData)
}
```

### Data Flow
1. **User Action**: Completes real-world activity (workout, lesson, savings goal)
2. **Partner Verification**: Play'd verifies action through partner APIs (Fitbit, Coursera, Plaid)
3. **Coin Award**: Play'd Coins credited to user account
4. **Game Notification**: SDK notifies game of available rewards
5. **Currency Conversion**: Play'd Coins converted to game-specific currency
6. **Revenue Distribution**: 70/30 split processed automatically

### Demo Game Example: "City Builder Lite"
```javascript
// Game integration example
PlaydSDK.initialize("demo_city_builder_2025");

// Player needs coins to build next building
function needMoreCoins() {
    PlaydSDK.requestReward(100, "coins", (success) => {
        if (success) {
            showRewardAvailable();
        } else {
            showEarnRewardsOptions();
        }
    });
}

// Automatic reward from completed workout
PlaydSDK.onRewardEarned((reward) => {
    game.coins += reward.amount;
    showRewardNotification(`Earned ${reward.amount} coins for completing workout!`);
});
```

### Technical Implementation

#### Backend Architecture (Node.js/Express)
```javascript
// Core API endpoints
app.post('/api/games/register', registerGame);
app.post('/api/rewards/request', requestReward);
app.post('/api/actions/verify', verifyPartnerAction);
app.get('/api/analytics/revenue', getRevenueAnalytics);
```

#### Frontend SDK (JavaScript)
```javascript
class PlaydSDK {
    constructor(apiKey, gameId) {
        this.apiKey = apiKey;
        this.gameId = gameId;
        this.baseUrl = 'https://api.playd.com';
    }

    async requestReward(amount, type) {
        const response = await fetch(`${this.baseUrl}/rewards/request`, {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${this.apiKey}` },
            body: JSON.stringify({ amount, type, gameId: this.gameId })
        });
        return response.json();
    }
}
```

#### Database Schema
```sql
-- Games table
CREATE TABLE games (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    api_key VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    revenue_share DECIMAL(3,2),
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Rewards table
CREATE TABLE rewards (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID,
    game_id UUID,
    playd_coins INTEGER,
    game_currency_amount INTEGER,
    game_currency_type VARCHAR(50),
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```
