4. Once installed, double-click any `.swift` file in this folder to open the project

### Option 2: Use Xcode Cloud (Alternative)
1. Upload this folder to a GitHub repository
2. Use Xcode Cloud to build and test

### Option 3: Manual Setup in Xcode
1. Open Xcode
2. Create a new iOS App project
3. Choose:
   - Product Name: PlaydApp
   - Team: Your Apple ID
   - Organization Identifier: com.jardine3
   - Interface: SwiftUI
   - Language: Swift
4. Copy all `.swift` files from this folder into the new project
5. Enable Game Center capability in project settings

## ðŸŽ® App Structure

```
PlaydApp/
â”œâ”€â”€ PlaydApp.swift          # Main app entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ ContentView.swift       # Main view with tab navigation

â”œâ”€â”€ UserState.swift         # Global state management
â”œâ”€â”€ NetworkManager.swift    # API communication layer
â”œâ”€â”€ Models.swift           # Data models
â”œâ”€â”€ GamesView.swift        # Games tab (Mistplay-style)
â””â”€â”€ EarnView.swift         # Earn tab (Apple Fitness-style)

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

The app connects to the backend at `http://localhost:5000`. To change this:

2. Update `private let baseURL = "http://localhost:5000"`
3. Change to your server URL

## ðŸ“² Testing Without Xcode

You can review the Swift code in any text editor. The app follows standard SwiftUI patterns and is fully commented for readability.

Key files to review:
- `GamesView.swift` - See the Mistplay-inspired redemption interface
- `EarnView.swift` - See the Apple Fitness-inspired challenges interface
- `NetworkManager.swift` - Understand the API integration

3. Games tab: Claim daily streak for 120 coins
