🎯 The Problem

Kids and Gen Z spend hours every day on their phones — and the #1 thing they’re doing is gaming.
Mobile gaming now sees 3B monthly app downloads every year, and 75% of players are Gen Z.

Here’s the issue:
	•	1.5B of these gamers are actively paying, spending an average of $174/year on in-game purchases.
	•	They’re trading real money for coins and skins… while 67% of them are living paycheck to paycheck.
	•	Instead of learning good financial habits, games are reinforcing detachment from the value of money.

And the alternatives? Financial literacy apps and gamified classes? Kids hate them. They don’t engage.

💡 The Play’d Solution

Play’d flips the script. We turn gaming addiction into positive action by connecting in-game rewards to real-world good habits.

Imagine this:
You’re playing Madden 26 on your phone and want to add Peyton Manning to your team. Normally that’s 1,000 Madden Coins = $5.99 down the drain.

With Play’d, instead of paying cash, you go to the Play’d Marketplace:
	•	Add money to your savings account.
	•	Instantly exchange that for Madden Coins.
	•	Unlock Peyton Manning for your squad while building your real-life wealth.

We’re rewiring the psychology of money — using the same dopamine loops that make gaming addictive, but to train healthier financial, wellness, and learning habits.

💰 The Business Model

Banks, wellness apps, and learning platforms are desperate to reach Gen Z. Play’d gives them direct access to 3B mobile gamers through a platform kids already love.

Our monetization comes from:
	•	Partnerships with financial, wellness, and learning platforms.
	•	Transaction fees when players earn in-game currency by doing real-world good.

Instead of “pay to play,” it’s finally time for get paid to play.
